# spanish_biber_tag_checker

Modified from Adriana Picoral's English-language Biber Tag Checker ( https://github.com/writecrow/coding_tools/tree/master/biber_tag_checker ) to interface with documents tagged by the Spanish Biber Tagger.

Known glitches:
Sometimes two words matching your filter criteria appearing consecutively will disable the "Next" button. If this happens, scroll through the document and click on the next highlighted word to resume fixtagging.

What you'll find here:

prespart_checker.html: Used for checking present participles.

pastpart_checker.html: Used for checking past participles.

que_checker.html: Used for checking tokens of "que".
